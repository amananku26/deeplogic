### How to Run?
I tried cloning Time news today, it took me 2 hrs to make it. to start it you have to install axios and json-server in your react app and i did it using redux store for new Auth, i created db.json and put all the news there and called it using axios in context api and then i call the store in my home page and applied news . please have a look on it and feel free to reach out to me if you have any query.
